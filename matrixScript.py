# Matrix Script : Regex and Parsing - Hard Practice Problem
'''
# Neo has a complex matrix script. The matrix script is a  X  grid of strings. 
# It consists of alphanumeric characters, spaces and symbols (!,@,#,$,%,&).

# To decode the script, Neo needs to read each column and select only the alphanumeric characters and connect them. 
# Neo reads the column from top to bottom and starts reading from the leftmost column.
# If there are symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters of the decoded script, 
# then Neo replaces them with a single space '' for better readability.
# Neo feels that there is no need to use 'if' conditions for decoding.
# Alphanumeric characters consist of: [A-Z, a-z, and 0-9].
